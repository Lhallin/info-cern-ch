# Updated README File

<br>

While working on this <b>Info-cern-ch</b> the File added: "Index.html"

was created to demonstrate keybording and HTML Understanding.

In Haste to make up some lost time.   Still in producing this 

File, a tremendous amount of links were reproduced and examining 

the code should validate it is almost a perfect copy.

additionaly, most of the links employed id tags which seemed

painstakingly tedious but this is the nature of coding.

I added a footer which I thought was a nice touch with a 

smart copyright using the **ascii** encoding for special character's

and linked the page to other web pages making the page a part of

Network of documents to live in the cloud or as one might think 

"It Live's on the **WOLRD WIDE WEB**"


Since, I will in future assignments have the opportunity to 

demonstrate creativity in My Web pages, I take pride in

the production of this page at this time in the course.
