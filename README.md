# Updated README File

While working on this *Info-cern-ch* the File added: "Index.html"

was created to demonstrate keybording and HTML Understanding.

In Haste to make up some lost time.  Still in producing this 

File, a tremendous amount of links were reproduced and examining 

the code should validate it is almost a perfect copy.

additionaly, most of the links employed id tags which seemed

painstakingly tedious but this is the nature of coding.



I added a footer which I thought was a nice touch with a 

smart copyright using the ascii encoded special character


Since, I will in future assignments have the opportunity to 

demonstrate creativity in My Web pages, I take pride in

the production of this page at this time in the course.
